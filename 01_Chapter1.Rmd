## Methods

This is how I did the thing with this data (Table \@ref(tab:testtable))

```{r include=FALSE}
data("mtcars")
```

```{r testtable}
knitr::kable(summary(cars), caption = "Summary of the mtcars data.", booktabs=TRUE)
```

## Results A Really Long Heading so I see what happens when it takes up more than one line just in case we're getting crazy

### Level 3 A Really Long Heading so I see what happens when it takes up more than one line just in case we're getting crazy

#### Level 4 A Really Long Heading so I see what happens when it takes up more than one line just in case we're getting crazy

##### Level 5 A Really Long Heading so I see what happens when it takes up more than one line just in case we're getting crazy

### A Really Long Heading so I see what happens when it takes up more than one line just in case we're getting crazy

These are my first results (Figure \@ref(fig:cars-plot)).

```{r cars-plot, fig.cap="The cars data. Sentence two.", fig.scap= "The cars data."}
#For a multi-sentence caption use fig.scap set as the first sentence so only that goes to the table of figures
plot(cars)  # a scatterplot
```

And then I also got these results (Figure \@ref(fig:test-fig)).

```{r include=FALSE}
png(filename = "Figures/pressure_plot.png",width = 5, height = 4, units = "in", res = 300)
plot(pressure, main="Pressure Plot")
dev.off()
```

```{r test-fig, fig.cap= "A really long figure caption so I see what happens when it takes up more than one line just in case we're getting crazy"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/pressure_plot.png")
```

```{r testtable-2}
knitr::kable(head(cars), caption = "A really long table caption so I see what happens when it takes up more than one line just in case we're getting crazy")
```

## Discussion

Now I tell you how this fits in the context of my field
